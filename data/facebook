The shameful, unethical, and disgraceful chaos that ensued today is not what the world needs to see. This is not the America the world needs to see. And hopefully this stops here.

Because of him, we all got out OK. The firefighters even managed to put the lid on the stew my mom was making, and one of them brought the pot out to us while they were fighting the fire.

These nutrients greatly support the immune system and can help prevent an illness from becoming serious and even prevent death from the Covid-19 virus, as well as other viruses. Do some research, please.\n\nEven when you get a vaccine, it‚Äôs your immune system that must fight the virus. A proper vaccine jump-starts your immune system in detecting and fighting the virus. A vaccine gives your immune system a head-start to battle the virus.\n\nInterestingly, they have found that zinc slows down the activity of the virus and this enables your body's immune system to catch-up in fighting the virus.\n\nIt takes only pennies a day of supplements to prevent terrible and easily avoidable tragedy.\n",

This is the first time PEG had been used in an approved vaccine, and it has side effects people with underlying health conditions like heart issues need to know.

Has no one else noticed that we are short of nurses in ICUs, and in the ER during this pandemic? Before COVID ever showed up we were short of all medical personnel at all levels. And now it is worse. over 3000 medical personnel have died of COVID in the US to date. The main person who actually does the injection of the vaccines are nurses. Where are you going to get more of those? Pull these top trained professionals out of the ICU, the ER? We are short staffed on nurses in all categories. More personnel, such as medical assistants and CNAs and home health aides, need to be pulled in for administering vaccines. One RN could supervise 6 of these or more. We have to conserve our top personnel. And NPs and PAs and doctors have all been trained in injections in their original training. With a quick review, they can do this also. These vaccines have to be recorded and data stored. This is just as important so in the long run researchers can follow all this data and determine which is most efficient or long lasting or has least side affects. Those of you not in medicine do not understand there are a lot of important moving parts to this massive vaccination program and it must be done correctly to meet medical standards and to maintain safety protocols.",

I was hurt and depressed, I was too curious and wanted to try doctor sambola then i contacted him through his when i contact him, he assured me 100% that he will heal me, i pleaded with him to help me out. My treatment was a great success, he healed me just as he promised. He sent me his medication and ask me to go for check up after 14 days of taking the medication. i agreed with him and i took his medication and went for check up, to my greatest surprise my result was negative after the treatment, i am really happy that i am cured and healthy again. I have waited for 3 weeks to be very sure i was completely healed before writing this testimony. I did another blood test one week ago and it was still Herpes negative. so i guess its time i recommend anyone going through Herpes HSV-1 or HSV-2, HIV, HPV, Hepatitis B, Diabetes, Cancer should reach him\nWHATSAPP: +2349050359822 drsambolahabermedicalcentre@gmail.com https://www.facebook.com/Dr-sambola-Herbal-medical-center-109570110957794/",

The main point is the integrity of the election process of which over 75 million Americans believe was NOT secure or accurate. Trust in the election process is crucial not only for citizens to be assured ALL is fair & secure but, also to the integrity & trust of the United States at home and around the globe. Many countries are laughing and raising eyebrows at us presently for a few reasons, one of which is the intentional suppression of illegal and corrupt information which was vital to a citizen's right to know and make an informed political decision. Until the entire system is investigated to the satisfaction of the citizens, the questioning will never stop and the trust will not be restored. This should be shared by ALL regardless of party, however, it appears the party being questioned (Democrat) doesn't care...go figure.",

Most (if not all to some extent) Presidents have wanted to leave office with grace, and the knowledge that they ‚Äútried‚Äù to perform the Presidential duties to the best of their ability. Yes, there were blunders, illegal activities and so on, but the American people stood together and demanded better from their government. This President has successfully divided the country. He has broken or bent more laws to get what HE wants. Not necessarily what‚Äôs best for the country. It‚Äôs tragic. It‚Äôs a travesty that the ‚Äúpeople‚Äù are supporting a person who is not competent to run a country. What was once a country built on honour, truth, and the interests of the common peoples best interests, it has been reduced to the degree of civil unrest that has and will continue to have severe consequences.

During a recent month in NHS hositals I wore Yellow or Red socks which gripped the ground and a month after leaving still in them as my feet swelled so could not get back into shoes. The only complaint I have is that they do not sufficiently grip both heels so spend too much time pulling them up from behind. I expect as usual that the Globalist placed a massive order outside of the UK as with non microwavable Plates, Bowls, Cups and Jugs with CHINA-PR [why with 53 Companies left in Stoke?], PPE, Face Masks [when O am now proud owner of Mars and others made in the UK?] wonder why as even if 30% more expensive employing Brits paying tax and hopefully the manufacturer also playing a significant and profitable part in those ¬£723 million annual sales. Would appreciate knowing if P... were asked to quote and if they know where they were made as even without any central heating I can wear them 24/7 with regular inspection of both heels as was the case in hospital ?",

I hope the human race has learnt its lesson by Covid19 because this pandemic evolved because the human race was destroying the environment and other species.

      "postContent": "The last six minutes of ET 302\n\nAccording to international employment, the list of ET 302 flight history has been published on the first level report.\n\nThe first level report has submitted the interview with Air Traffic controllers, information in the box and audio recorded in the Pilots room. The pilot who asked his name not to mention is funny to BBC according to the first level report.\n\nSunday morning March 1/2011 Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 max 8 airplane is getting ready to fly to Nairobi Kenya with 302 airplanes including 8 workers including 157 workers.\n\nMorning 02·ç°37·ç°34-Air Traffic Pilots started preparing to board the plane and allow 119.7 hectares to connect with 119.7 heres.\n\nAir Traffic Authorities confirm that they have given a single plane (Tech of Clarans) priorities. Among these, there are no airplanes that arise and rest at the same time, the airplanes that are completed and similar.\n\nAnd then the plane started to close to the rural battle (Ranway) 07 R (07 right). According to the direction of the pilot who gave us the explanation, the way the plane will get the name (Ranway) is based on direction. Including the pilots of Ethiopian airlines also suggest where the airplanes fly. For example ET 3 xx flight numbers are reaching East Africa and starting with ET 5 xx and North America and ET 6 xx.\n\n02·ç°37·ç°34-The airplane chief airplane is flying.\n\n02·ç°38·ç°44-After the plane crashed immediately, meaning the information that the airplane has started to move on the left and right wing shows that the information is out of the right wing.\n\n02·ç°38·ç°46-It has been heard that the pilot of ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ Master Caution Anti-Ice ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ has been warned to the pilot. Master Caution (Master Caution) says the airplane is a system that shows the airplane's ' Master Caution Anti-Ice ' warning ' is part of the airplane's problem.\n\n02·ç°38·ç°58-Even though the main pilot tried to put the airplane on a ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ bus ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ system, there was a message warning that the plane was not on a plane. Automobile means a method that allows the plane to fly in its own direction.\n\nAfter two seconds, the main pilot came back from the plane saying ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ command after 02·ç°39·ç°01 seconds, the airplane is not on pilot.\n\n02·ç°39·ç°06-five seconds later, the pilot contacted the airplane driver with air traffic controllers. The assistant pilot reported that ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ SHALA 2 A department crossing 8400 ft and climbing FL 320\nWhen the pilot says 'Shala 2 A' means some direction from Addis Ababa to Nairobi; they are cutting 8400 feet high and the pilot reported that they are flying high.\n\n02·ç°39·ç°45-Chief Flaps App (Flaps Up) Ordered to the Assistant Pilot.

      "postContent": "A clear letter to prime minister Abiy Ahmed\nvia vision media from citizens.\nThe issue is about remembering the knowledge, wisdom, behavior and ethics that is required to be the leader of Ethiopia.\n‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ Salt is sweet for yourself...\"\nIt is true that our country has been spreading a lot of storms in its history for thousands of years. Yet, in the past half century, in the past half century, and especially in the last quarter of life. Even though foreign invaders are burning to demolish her, Ethiopia was strong in the hearts of her citizens, she didn't have a hard time to re-plant life. In our generation and generation, we are hosting a domestic crisis that will be tested for 27 years. When the TPLF elected government is separated by the struggle of the people, they said Ethiopia, they have declared its greatness and the people have thrown their hope on you to the light. Don't touch the mistakes you make every time by your administration, the choices you notice, the press release, actions and messages that people have thrown at you. So, we have become to write this letter of deep complaint to you.\n1. Your words and actions don't know each other.\nAfter being the prime minister of your party, they promise that they will make Ethiopians to listen and respect each other.\nWhat you gather around you and gather around you is those who are sick of living in Ethiopia as a country.\nEven if they preach about peace, they will be awarded with sticks and rumors.\nEven though we hear that the peaceful struggle is the only option that is acceptable is the one that rapes the banks saying ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ it's a mouthful, they deserve it...\" but they claim that they don't release weapons in public, they are robbing banks.\nEven though they talk about the queen of ideas, they are the ones who steal and record swords, they are on the people who present peaceful protest.\nEven though they talk about transparency and accountability, they have removed the list of the contracts they have bought in the name of Ethiopia and the people from media.\nEven though millions of millions are playing when one citizen is sick, they have not only received their call for the safety of citizens but also your beauty of your children and Ethiopians.\nThey say Merhoye is a citizen and they are spreading citizens on the streets.\nEven if you repeatedly know your determination for democracy and freedom, you and your social media that doesn't praise you, you and your government will be ashamed.\nEven if you are ruled by your honesty and loyalty in public, you will regret it when you repeatedly criticize your tongue. Even if we list all your words and actions, we won't be enough to write. So we as citizens look at this and believe that it is better to think and believe that it is better to not take what they are saying.\n2. war proclamation on Addis Ababa and Addis Ababa\nAddis Ababa's Baladera Council has been dismissed. The war proclamation has also been declared on Addis Ababa's rights activists. They are threatening to kill and arrest. This speech has removed your mask and revealed your true identity. Let's remind you of some serious things about this.\n2.1 First of all Eskinder Nega and all Ethiopians fought for the sake of racism and dictatorship for 3 years, not for the sake of heroism and humanity. Believe us, even Eskinder's great journalists and rights activists who gave everything to Ethiopia, no one will be imprisoned in your hell to call them heroes. It is not better to be imprisoned by those who don't know human respect to be a hero. These heroes were arrested, tortured, displaced and paid life for you and your likes assembled in low service and opposed racism.\n2.2 many crimes and shameful things are being done by extremists who say be strong why is your mouth open now to declare a peaceful war in Addis Ababa? Where were you when ethiopian massacred in Burayu? So why didn't they dare to call the massacre and condemn the threats you and your organization are in a peaceful way to threaten Addis Ababa? What do you say when Addis Ababa is killed by your security force, Due process of illegal process of law is over a month in military training? After a while, they laughed at each other saying they were imprisoned for the change When it was said that there is 2 government in the country, where was your mouth when we were told that we can surround Addis Ababa and kneel down?\nNow we have seen Addis Ababa being united. What is the word of a racist group that is called Haromsa Finfine and other Ethiopians who are in Addis Ababa saying ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ Qerro will die for Finfine ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤\nDo people ever know when Takele Uma is cheating? When people were crucified on Shashemene, OLF and robbed, where Addis Ababa paid and the house they found and found in lottery, was it a decision taken by the government that was banned by you, Addis Ababa, Legetafo and many other cities to be destroyed and children, souls and the old women and the way? Even if the action they took is not good for Addis Ababa.\nMr. Bekele Gerban's disgusting speech, that doesn't have a legal ability to condemn the ethnic group, you don't have the right to support Addis Ababa, when citizens are displaced by millions of racists, you don't have a moral ability to deny the right to support Addis Ababa.\nWe deserve what they say for sure. Now what they say to us:\nYou reached me without making the political field comfortable for me.\nYou woke me up before I changed Addis Ababa and its surroundings.\nBefore the election happens, you hugged me before I was fooling him.\nIn Addis Ababa, you know that I have not approved the single crown by itself in Addis Ababa. Don't tell us ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ sleep for me and let me be sick ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ and don't despise people like this.\nSo, not only the opposite of your speech and actions, but also the breakdown of your speech and your speech, we don't have enough time to explain the skill, number, facts, and all the interpretation of advice.\nAn important advice.\nIf you have a heart and ears that are left with power, take note of these points.\n1 There is no earthly force that can stop Addis Ababa or Ethiopian from fighting for its rights. Note that Addis Ababa and Ethiopians are not afraid of oppressors. Don't mess with those who don't. Don't fight with those who don't stop.\n2 learn from your priorities. If you don't think bad about Addis Ababa, we advise you if you don't do anything bad for you. This is not good for TPLF to kill all of them.\n3 Don't forget that they were elected by the people but by EPRDF. Whether it is competitive or not with the minds of the country. Don't despise the people, don't ball. We hear them robbing the people of Ethiopia repeatedly saying ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ Ethiopian people ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ This action has made you easier, not less respect than the people.\n4 Don't mix your history, make your final power beautiful. We will tell you that you respect Ethiopia because you are in power and we will tell you not to rob the people who support you. Don't break those steps that are stepping down from power when they get out of power. Because that brings a crushing on the top.\n5 If you can, until the people make their choice, history has become the prime minister of this great country, have that great character, ethics and vision.\nEven if you don't have a few time of power, if you don't say you are the prime minister of Ethiopians, if you don't lower to one village, you are a torture that is put on the people, the country will give birth to its own solution. Don't doubt this.\nThe Bible says salt is sweet for yourself.\nLet him show you the left and right.\nWith the peace of mind.\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

When the Boeing Governor wants anything, he will take them as willing to be Ethiopian Airlines. Airways sells 5 planes each after buying 90 million dollars back to South America one company for $ 120 million each. After buying this company will rent it for Ethiopian airlines for 25 years. That means until the airplanes get old. More than 15 million dollars commission has been opened on this deal.\n\n- This plane that lights up on Liz rental has been seated because of motor oil problems and also caused by Rolls-Royce Trent 1000 motor problem. This plane's license fee is $ 800,000 to $ 1.25 million per month. Does it mean that the government pays $ 1.25 million per month without working? And the airline loses up to 110 thousand dollars a day.\n- Ethiopian airlines manager has a private plane (it is said that she has a share with the referee). Boeing 767-300 ER ET AMF. Egypt and Tanzania will fly in the majority of the plane. Mr. Tewelde has built a 5-star hotel in Sisheles and others who are going to take advantage of this hotel in Ethiopian Airlines. The leaders of TPLF and Metekel spend the weekend and Sunday in this hotel.\n- 67 million dollars collected in foreign airline ticket sales has been brought to the country. In addition, the 85 million dollar should be made for the country by individuals bank of Metec and Wogagen Bank.\n\n- The airline manager has been busy hiring workers in ethnicity and relatives. Second wife in Los Angeles Airport manager. Board without permission, the airline manager will do medical checkup every two months in Germany. This has costed millions of dollars too.\n- Last year 450 flight attendants, 80 technicians, pilots and hundreds of others have been released due to their race.\n- The referee and Tewelde bought Metec for another company (Asia Nepal and the information will be investigated because it is not sure). The link is born.\n- The airline manager has been born in the name of Zemedu Gebreagheer 4 different buildings in Addis Ababa. Adiam Gebrezabher is the owner of Samuel Sunshine, the buildings are built by Sun Shain Construction. Adiyam Gebre God is known for importing modern cars from Germany.\n\n- The buildings that the airline built for workers have lost millions of birr by giving only one ethnicity and leaving the company that won to build buildings for one TPLF (Afro Show).\n- The airline manager of public relations takes salary from the airport not the airport.\n- The airline digital department will hire more than 120 IT professionals using social media to share with people. These days they have reduced to 60 by fear of being known.\n- The airline has given a warning to many countries that the airlines and elephant horn and honorable mining has entered into the business of ELEGAL.\n- For workers housing money from PTA bank is borrowed millions of dollars but it doesn't know where half of the house is.\n- 2.4 million birr have been distributed to pilgrimage hotels and food. This happened to Haji travelers have been dreaming about food and sleep for many days.\n- When the airport is audited, it has taken a lot of money and it is found to waste more than 45 million birr.\n- Two earthly prisoners were found in the airport. Staff are raped in this prison, dead.\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

What information does the Ethiopian government have? Where are those who were saying they were eating with Alamudin and drinking while they were trading while they were eating? Alamudi is not their issue.\n\nBut we don't want Mohammed Bin Salman to be victimized for the help of some Ethiopians who were given to their help.\n\nIf they are asked corruption, they should be in court properly.

As a data we gathered with a friend, there were 45 conflicts in the past year. There is a displacement of people among these 20 This summary will be half of the conflicts seen in 26 years.\n\nThese bad deeds are not automatically done. It is clear that there are people who don't wish good for the Ethiopian people.\n----\nThe purpose of the conflict and displaced people can be seen in two levels.\n\n#Before March 2010th, the coming generation will take over the conflicts to prevent team Lemma from coming to power and stop the struggle for freedom.\n\n#Dr. Abiy Ahmed has been elected as the government of March, and after that the people of Majirat should give bad look to the new government, creating division between the fighters, pushing the government to only focus on the conflicts, pushing the people to learn from Dr. Abiy's government to revolution and protest. It is giving up and giving up his power.\n----\nSo if Dr. Abiy's government leaves power, will the government come to his place? Absolutely!! The wish of the coming generation of Majirat is to establish an oppressive system that our country has never seen before. And that's why it's always ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤ wake up My message that says take care of each other.\n----\nThe coming team Majirat is always hurt by regarding our small differences as weakness. If we want to achieve his goals, we have to hold our hands in order to not succeed.\n----\nSo friends, so friends\nBe able to do it!\nBe one of them!\nHold your hands for your hands!\n\nLet us protect our differences from our enemies who wish us slavery.\n\nLet's all stand with our prime minister Dr. Abiy Ahmed!!\n----\nShare, share, share, share\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

      "postContent": "Professor Berhanu's prediction and Abay dam.\n\nSeptember doesn't suck without hearing shock.\n\nProfessor Birhanu Nega once said this after Abay dam was thrown by stone. When any development is reduced in Ethiopia, we won't go down and ask why it is planned or made. We are the ones who are proud of the development of our country.\n\nWhen we come to Abay Dam, the project started for the sake of political benefit, not planned and not planned. The goat that was thrown on the Ethiopian people suddenly is a dub.\n\nThe prime minister who was jealous of the current revolution in Arab countries, put it on the people.\nYet it was planned for the sake of politics that didn't expect time and time.\n\nThe robbery, theft, theft, the corruption became like there are other things. If it wasn't bad to be planned. I don't believe that the question will complete such projects with their capacity and knowledge.\n\nI rather wish they build a lot of small dams and slippers and end up starving our people.\n\nBire said this five years later\n\nEmotion is bound by emotion. Let me say dam is limited by knowledge not by emotion. Our dam has confirmed that Walta has been built in the center of information.\n\nWalta's news has been made from hot news to dam? Thanks for changing the documentary.\nUnder the title of Walta renaissance\n\nHere are some amazing magicians.\nWhile we expected the Abay dam to end; it is said that the case of those who ate the money has been caught in court.\n\nSalini's big dam projects, the civil service cutting company, has submitted a question for loss.\n\nEthiopians must pay the money for the cross.\n\nAbay dam project was only audited in 7 years.\n\nThe new leadership is being led by the prime minister, it is difficult to get enough information and get into his job quickly.\n\nIt is believed that there is false, mixed human power, finance information and corrupted work process, false information created for the new administration. He has made obstacles not to push all his work and don't work.\n\n60 % of fake information has been found.\n\nAs planned, unpaid jobs have been done, paid.\n\nThere is no correct document about the beginning of the Abay dam and the process of implementation. All the needles have been found fake.\n\nAbay does not have any organized information to explain the current status. In short Abay has become historyless.\n\nThose who say we have experience in Militre Engineering means Metekel, Salsins have not experienced enough, working with Salini Engineering, and putting on high pressure, money loss and psychological pressure.\n\nEven if Salini doesn't want Metekel and companies that have experience to work with him repeatedly. Eye-outer METEC has made a big buggy on the part of Salini's work while we work.\n\nIt will continue.\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

Politics is different. Teff is a matter of humanity.\n·ç£\n‚úÖ‚úÖ!! So a race that has surrounded the question of humanity can't explain the value of human beings. If a person who is baptized by saying give it will be given to you, it can't be a role model for giving and giving. He who killed his neighbor can't love me far away. The holy word who has been with you can't fight for me without your brother who hates you for years can't fight for me freedom.\n·ç£\n‚úÖ‚úÖ!! I won't hear the person who killed the Tigre who died on the cross saying Jesus is Lord. If the person who crucified the Lord worships God, it is right to worship Satan. You can't share the people who are trained to be stupid The feeling of responsibility is caution not fear.\n·ç£\n‚úÖ‚úÖ!! In fact, your courage is also your courage not your heroism. You can't teach me about the respect of human beings by leaving your body and worrying about your race. You can't say you insulted me when you are destroying Ethiopianism. You can't tell me the love I lost with Tigre because I love Tigre.\n·ç£\n‚úÖ‚úÖ!!Ô∏è I lead by my own moral. If I like me why can't the sky and earth change. I like it if I like it. Not only you can benefit yourself, if I like the country called Ethiopia, I don't care if you leave.\n·ç£\n‚úÖ‚úÖ!! so you can't make me feel narrow in your heart but you can't make me feel guilty. I don't care about you except what I feel right. I have never respected cattle after all.\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

Yet the institutions that say their words are not seen on the scale are being listened to.\n.\n20 dinner invitations have been celebrated in the palace in four months of power. Dinner people who have names in society are welcomed, listened or fame. What's the point of having these people invited dinner? ' People went out and condemned when people were crucified, they protested when killed by their race, when millions were displaced, they collaborated to help (using their fame) and supported the answer is nothing.\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

In Meles's era, you would have made a person to hang in public, instead of stealing a car carrying a grain; even jumping the government in a newspaper and sue you to get down with terrorism. The government of Meles will rule you like a name by its swords. There's no meaning to breath.\n\n.. Abiy Ahmed's government will rule you with love, reconciliation and unity with his two hands In the era of Abiy, you are allowed to burn people in the streets and steal property. Abiy's government will make you look like a sheep with a palm tree that has two hands. You are told to just relax and live.\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ\n\nBoth governments are wrong on this side.\n\nJust like ruling people by sword is not appropriate; it is not appropriate to say only by a palm tree. If governments hold palm on their right hand, they should hold swords on their left hand.\n\nDear Dr. Abiy!\n\nBuy what is bought with love, and order what is not bought by love.\n\nWith one hand palm, with the other hand they rule us with sword. Shop with fire and outside!!\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",

      "postContent": "Dr. #Debretsion and the #Renaissance dam question.\nWith the thanksgiving z-gion\n====================================\nAll the information that was included in this article was sent from a worker who was built in the renaissance dam but it was not posted on time. Engineer Simegnew passed away today, but I was forced to post a minimum investigation on the information.\n‚û° 3 years ago workers who work on the renaissance dam raise their salaries by saying they are reduced. Dr. Debretsion, who led to the place to calm the protest and to discuss with workers has been stopped by insulting and threatening. That day at 3:30 Federal police has been forced to go back to work by beating the workers from the dam 8 km far from Bamza for 2 days.\n:\n‚û° It has been reported that Dr. Abiy has been found in the problems he has been raised about the salary of workers and the forest carpet. The information the engineer gave to the prime minister about employees is different from the real salary. The prime minister is sad with this and the engineers are not participating during the meeting. It is also told that workers who have been signed before and know that there are two types of payrolls in the project, why are they being ruled in our name by Meteke's house. Saleni Construction Manager Mr. Saleni Construction Manager regarding this employee payroll. Feraro has revealed.\n[From this we understand that Metec generals have been paying half of the salary of 17,000 employees and the people and their own people. The engineer who knows the secret of this robbery and the implementation. There might be a bond of benefit]\n·ç°\nAnd the other one has been given auction for Metec. When METEC takes this job, it's agreed to provide paper factories. It is predicted that the dam will sleep back to Amhara region and it can reach more than 200 km. But Meteke went out to provide 150 Km wooden furniture that was supposed to be used for paper factory fire.\n[According to this, billion birr have robbed us without doing anything, and they know the secret of this detail :: In my opinion, those who participated in the dam are corrupted; the engineers who were killed may be connected to the secret of the robbery and benefit of the robbery ::\n·ç°\nIt doesn't continue.......\n\n ¬∑ Rate Translation",
